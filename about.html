            <div class="content">
                <p>At a dinner in Los Angeles in early 2014 on North Doheny, the two founders of SidePaper – with decades of combined industry experience between them – sat together and talked about the state of small businesses in the USA. The outlook, unfortunately, wasn’t
                    that great. Recent governmental mandates (ranging from health- care costs to a rising minimum wage) coupled with a slowing rebound of the consumer have put more pressure than ever on small businesses – the very same small businesses
                    that have historically driven our country’s economy.
                </p>

        <div class="iconic">
            <img src="img/guys2.png" alt="">
            <div class="content">
                <p>And our founders? Well, they thought that didn’t really make sense. So they began to speak with small businesses around the country. What problems were small businesses facing in 2014? What were some of the opportunities that businesses were missing? How easy was it to grow your business, if things were going well and you wanted to expand? What was the state of the American Dream?
                </p>

        </div>
        <div class="iconic">
            <img src="img/guys3.png" alt="">
            <div class="content">
                <p>And after asking all of these questions, what they found was pretty telling. Small businesses were struggling, and really, for some very basic reasons. Seemingly everyone needed financial advice – how to think about cash flow projections and managing for the future. Other businesses were concerned that they were falling behind in marketing efforts, in what has become increasingly a digital era.<br><br>But most importantly, our founders found that what people really needed the most was capital.<br><br>Money to grow and build their businesses !
                </p>

        <div class="iconic">
            <img src="img/guys4.png" alt="">
            <div class="content">
                <p>They learned that when the recession hit, the larger banks had crazy restrictions placed on their ability to lend money – simply put, the government asked the larger financial institutions to keep more cash on their own balance sheets. And so the banks that had historically lent to small businesses (to fund growth or cash flow management) all of a sudden had to choose between lending to smaller businesses that were potentially riskier or lending to larger corporations that had more of a credit history.
                </p>

        <div class="iconic">
            <img src="img/guys5.png" alt="">
            <div class="content">
                <p>And when our founders started putting the pieces together, they sort of realized that none of this was really fair. Small businesses are the engine that drives this country, and yet, small businesses are the ones facing capital concerns, financial management question marks and a lack of a marketing know-how in a day that mandates it. That didn’t really make sense to us.<br><br>And so, SidePaper was built. It was built to provide support to small businesses, in the most affordable and sensible way possible.</p>
